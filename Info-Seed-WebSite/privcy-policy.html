It is important that You understand Your responsibilities and the limitations to the services which You choose to use. Our services are diverse and as a result additional service specific terms may apply. If this is the case, these service specific terms shall become part of Our agreement. &nbsp;</p>
                                    <p>Please use Our services responsibly. By using Our website or any of Our services, You agree to Our Terms. Take note that these Terms change from time to time.

                                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>1. Introduction &nbsp;</p>
                                    <p>1.1. You wish to use INFOSEED services (meaning services as provided under these Terms; hereinafter &ldquo;Service,&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Services&rdquo;). &nbsp;</p>
                                    <p>1.2. INFOSEED means INFOSEED LTD, a company registered in the United Kingdom and whose registered office is situated at 5th Floor, 35-38 New Bridge Street London EC4V 6BW (hereinafter &bdquo;INFOSEED&ldquo;; &bdquo;We&ldquo;; &bdquo;Our&ldquo;; &bdquo;Us&ldquo;). &nbsp;</p>
                                    <p>1.3. You wish to use the Services and We are willing to make the Services available to You subject to and in accordance with these Terms &nbsp;</p>
                                    <p>2. Binding Effect &nbsp;</p>
                                    <p>2.1. You are entering into a binding agreement. If You accept these Terms of use of Our Service on behalf of Your employer or another person, You confirm that You have the consent of Your employer or that person to act on their behalf. THESE TERMS APPLY TO ALL RECORDS RELATING TO ALL TRANSACTIONS YOU ENTER INTO ON INFOSEED&rsquo;S WEBSITE, INCLUDING NOTICES OF CANCELLATION, POLICIES, CONTRACTS, AND APPLICATIONS. In order to access and retain your electronic records, You may be required to have certain hardware and software, which are Your sole responsibility. &nbsp;</p>
                                    <p>2.2. You are not eligible to accept these Terms or use Our Services if You are not of legal age to form a binding contract with Us or if You are barred by law to use Our services. &nbsp;</p>
                                    <p>2.3. In the event there is an agreement in place between You and Infoseed for any or all Services used, such agreement shall have precedence of application before these Terms. &nbsp;</p>
                                    <p>3. The Service &nbsp;</p>
                                    <p>The Service enables a Customer to use Our mobile services as set out as part of Your online registration. Any such billable unit under the Services shall be referred in these Terms and Conditions as a &ldquo;Chargeable Event&rdquo;. &nbsp;</p>
                                    <p>Any individual Service that You will use under these Terms shall be provided in accordance with the respective particulars, that You accept, as found on &nbsp;(the &ldquo;Service Description&ldquo;). By accepting these Terms, You accept the application of the Service Description and confirm that you are familiar with them. &nbsp;INFOSEED reserves the right to change or modify the Service Description at any time and in its sole discretion. &nbsp;</p>
                                    <p>4. Availability and Interruption of the Service &nbsp;</p>
                                    <p>4.1. We will make the Services available to You using reasonable skill and care. You do however acknowledge and agree that the availability of the Services, Your ability to access and/or use the Services and the conducting of any given Chargeable Event may depend upon factors beyond Our reasonable control, including (but not limited to): &nbsp;</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Factors affecting the operation of the Services and/or preventing Chargeable Event from being successfully conducted such as, by way of example, geographical or topographical shortcomings in the network of any telecommunications network operator (&ldquo;Network Operator&rdquo;), network capacity, physical obstructions or atmospheric conditions; or &nbsp;</li>
                                        <li>Factors preventing end-users from receiving Chargeable Events such as, by way of example, the terms and conditions of an end-user&rsquo;s service provider. &nbsp;</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>4.2. We cannot therefore guarantee: &nbsp;</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>That the Services will be available to You at all times or free from faults or interruptions; &nbsp;</li>

                                    <p>2. About Infoseed Services &nbsp;</p>
                                    <p>Infoseed is a Communications Platform-as-a-Service (CPaaS) and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) provider. While providing Services to our customers, we act either as the controller or the processor, depending on the situation. &nbsp;</p>
                                    <p>Our activities as processor &nbsp;</p>
                                    <p>Our customers are mainly companies that integrate our Services into their business operations through their own software applications (via API) or by using Infoseed Portal, our web interface. By using our cloud communications platform, our customers are able to send or exchange their communications with their end-users using different communication channels (SMS, email, voice etc.). We are not in a direct relationship with our customers&rsquo; end-users, so we distribute these communications through telecom operators and other communications providers. When we do this, we act as the processor on behalf of our customers, and process the relevant data for the sole purpose of providing our Services to them. We do that within limits and according to customers&rsquo; instructions and in line with the Services terms and conditions, agreement for Services, or data processing or similar agreement concluded with the customer. &nbsp;</p>
                                    <p>For example, when you, as an end-user of our customer are the recipient of communication that our customer sent you by using our platform (such as an SMS message), we send that customer&rsquo;s communications acting on behalf of our customer. That means that the customer is the controller, and Infoseed is the processor. Any request we may receive from customers&rsquo; end-users regarding their rights related to our activities taken on behalf of our customers will be forwarded to customers, or the end-users will be asked to contact them directly. &nbsp;</p>
                                    <p>Our activities as controller &nbsp;</p>
                                    <p>This Privacy Notice describes the activities which Infoseed undertakes as controller. Infoseed is a controller when we process personal data for our own purposes and do not act on behalf of someone else. We are committed to processing that data as described in this Privacy Notice and respecting all obligations arising from the applicable privacy law. &nbsp;</p>
                                    <p>3. Who is responsible for your personal data? &nbsp;</p>
                                    <p>The main entity responsible for processing of personal data as described in this Privacy Notice &ndash; the controller &ndash; is Infoseed Limited, 35-38 New Bridge Street, Fifth Floor, London EC4V 6BW, United Kingdom with a registration number 7085757. &nbsp;</p>
                                    <p>For the purposes of EU data protection laws, Infoseed Limited has appointed its EU-based Data Protection Officer (&lsquo;DPO&rsquo;) as our EU Representative. Our DPO is contactable via the email address &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
                                    <p>Please note that depending on the specific contractual agreement applicable to you and the given processing activity, another Infoseed subsidiary or affiliate may be a controller for your personal data. Contact details of all Infoseed subsidiaries and affiliates are available at &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
                                    <p>If you have any questions regarding this Privacy Notice or our privacy practices, you may contact our Privacy team and Data Protection Officer via the email address &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

Any such sharing within the Infoseed Group is regulated by intercompany agreements on personal data processing and transfer. &nbsp;</p>
                                    <p>Before engaging any new supplier, we perform a security and privacy assessment. Where such supplier acts as our processor we ensure that the processing of personal data is governed by a written data processing agreement. &nbsp;</p>
                                    <p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, as a rule, we do not share personal data with third parties except when strictly necessary and on a need-to-know basis, such as with: &nbsp;</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Telecom operators and other communications service providers when necessary for the set-up of proper routing and connectivity. We are able to deliver messages that our customers send to their end-users, independent of where they are located, through our connections with telecoms and other communications providers (such as Whatsapp, Viber, Facebook, Kakaotalk, Line, or Telegram). &nbsp;</li>
                                        <li>Service and technology providers to the extent strictly necessary for them to perform specific actions on our behalf. These might be related both to our Services (e.g. as part of the functionality of our Services) and to our other processes (e.g. utilizing a software provider to manage our job application process). &nbsp;</li>
                                        <li>Third parties when required to comply with our legal obligations. We may share your personal data with authorised legal authorities due to relevant legislation, such as a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on us (e.g. for criminal procedures) or because of threats to public security, regulatory requirement, or in the context of investigations or bankruptcy. As a communications provider, we are required to retain certain communications-related data for law enforcement purposes and will be required to share that data with authorized law enforcement authorities upon their request. Also, if we are under an obligation to demonstrate compliance with relevant accounting, financial and tax legislation, your data can be shared with auditors and tax authorities for those purposes. &nbsp;</li>
                                        <li>Advertising partners that we might use as part of our marketing activities. More information is listed in our Cookie Policy along with an explanation of how to adjust your cookie settings when visiting our website. &nbsp;</li>
                                        <li>Merger and acquisition stakeholders as part of disclosure in the event of a merger, sale, or other asset transfer. Your information may be transferred as part of such a transaction, as permitted by law or contract. &nbsp;</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>7. How do we carry out international transfers of your personal data? &nbsp;</p>
                                    <p>We conduct our business operations globally, and sometimes we need to carry out international transfers of your personal data by providing your personal data to the parties specified in the section above. All international transfers are carried out while ensuring the confidentiality and security of your personal data and in line with the applicable privacy law. This might include specific technical, organisational, and contractual measures. For example, in relation to transfers of personal data outside the European Economic Area, we will complete and execute standard contractual clauses for data transfers where required. &nbsp;</p>
                                    <p>8. How do we secure your personal data? &nbsp;</p>
                                    <p>At Infoseed, we believe that security and privacy go hand in hand. In order to protect personal data collected and processed by us, we have therefore invested in the development, implementation, and constant improvement of a wide range of technical and organisational security measures. These measures have been implemented in accordance with ISO 27001:2013 standard requirements, and you can read more about them here. The list of our current and up-to-date certificates can be found here. &nbsp;</p>
                                    <p>We take care to train all our staff in the field of privacy and security, starting from their first day in Infoseed through the onboarding process and continuously throughout their stay at Infoseed. &nbsp;</p>
                                    <p>Before we engage a supplier, we check their security practices and alignment with the applicable privacy law. Once engaged, we continue to assess them on a regular basis. &nbsp;</p>
                                    <p>9. What are your rights in respect of your personal data? &nbsp;</p>
                                    <p>Depending on the applicable privacy law, you may have certain rights with respect to your personal data. &nbsp;</p>
                                    <p>Where granted by the applicable privacy law, you have the right to: &nbsp;</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Withdraw your consent to our processing of your personal data (to the extent such processing is based on your consent and consent is the only permissible basis for processing), without affecting the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal &nbsp;</li>
                                        <li>Request from us to access your personal data, which means requesting a copy of the personal data we hold about you &nbsp;</li>
                                        <li>Ask us to rectify (correct) your personal data that you think is inaccurate and to complete your personal data that you think is incomplete &nbsp;</li>
                                        <li>Ask us to erase your personal data in certain circumstances &nbsp;</li>
                                        <li>Ask us to restrict the processing of your personal data in certain circumstances &nbsp;</li>
                                        <li>If we process your personal data by automated means based on your consent or upon a contractual relation with you, you can exercise the right of data portability &nbsp;</li>
                                        <li>If we process your personal data upon our legitimate interest, you have the right to object to the processing &nbsp;</li>
                                        <li>If you want to object to the processing of your data for marketing purposes, you can do it at any time by using the unsubscribe link provided in our marketing communications &nbsp;</li>
                                        <li>You may also have specific rights in exceptional cases when we may carry out automated decision-making operations, including profiling. &nbsp;</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>If you have any questions on how we use your personal data or if you wish to exercise a certain right or resolve a complaint regarding the processing of your personal data, you can contact our Data Protection Officer by sending an email to the following email address: <a title="mailto:data-protection-officer@infoseed.com" href="mailto:data-protection-officer@Infoseed.com" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">data-protection-officer@Infoseed.com</a>. &nbsp;</p>
                                    <p>If applicable to you, you can lodge a complaint with the supervisory authority of the EU member state of your habitual residence, place of work, or place of the alleged infringement. If you want to file a complaint or contact the relevant data protection authority for any other reason, you may find contact details of EEA data protection authorities at <a title="https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en" href="https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en</a>. &nbsp;</p>
                                    <p>10. Do we conduct automated decision-making that significantly affects you? &nbsp;</p>
                                    <p>We take partially automated measurements that include human intervention in order to analyze the way users of our platform use the features and tools available (e.g. by tracking usage behavior inside our web interface) in order to give you recommendations to improve your performance (e.g. how to better access certain features). &nbsp;</p>
                                    <p>11. How long do we keep your personal data? &nbsp;</p>
                                    <p>Your personal data that has been collected based on your consent will be kept for a period specified in the consent. If you wish to withdraw your consent for the processing of your personal data for any purpose and to delete your data, you can do that at any time by sending an email to <a title="mailto:data-protection-officer@infoseed.com" href="mailto:data-protection-officer@Infoseed.com" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">data-protection-officer@Infoseed.com</a>. Regarding your personal data that is not subject to your consent, we will only keep it for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected before making it non-identifiable (anonymous) or deleting it, as required by law. &nbsp;</p>
                                    <p>Specific retention periods are listed under the respective activities in section 5 of this Privacy Notice. The retention periods listed are the standard default periods. In some cases, exceptions apply due to local laws related to law enforcement, tax, or other purposes. Additionally, if legal matters such as litigation, law enforcement requests, or government investigations require us to preserve records, including those containing personal information, for longer periods than listed in section 5, then we will delete the records in question when we are no longer legally obligated to retain them. &nbsp;</p>
                                    <p>12. Information from children &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
                                    <p>Children under 16 cannot use our products and services as our customers.

If you think a child under 16 is using our products or services as a customer, please contact us at <a title="mailto:data-protection-officer@infoseed.com" href="mailto:data-protection-officer@Infoseed.com" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">data-protection-officer@Infoseed.com</a>. &nbsp;</p>
                                    <p>13. How often do we update this Privacy Notice? &nbsp;</p>
